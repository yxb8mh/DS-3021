# Case Study 

## Main Problem: 
### Answer: The needs are not being met and the potential is not being maximized of educators and students due to poor utilization of resources.

## Target Variable: 
### The recommended resource or intervention for a school district based on the collected data. They are trying to develop a class variable based solution because they are recommending a specific type of resource or intervention.

## How would they know the solution was working (business metric)?
### We will know if its working based on improved student performance, teacher satisfaction, and long term cost savings that can be measured through post implementation feedback that is looped into the ML model.

## Additional challenges: 
### Problems with data collection: the dataset is small, and there are nuances in responses that are leading to biases and inconsistencies, making the dataset hard to draw conclusions from. Validation of system's effectiveness: is the model truly measuring what we need it to, is the model reliable? Ethics based issues: Biases in training data, over representation of certain district types

## Difficulty in gathering data: 
### There may be response biases and representation issues between school districts, possibility of select school districts dominating the percentage of responses, with others having less input based on the parameter of 1500 responses from 30 districts with no more than 100 from each. It is also difficult to ensure a representative sample of districts, with only 30 districts selected. 

## is the target difficult to measure: 
### it's pretty challenging because it involves measuring the outcomes of student performance, teacher satisfaction, and cost savings; with the first two outcomes being extremely difficult to quantify other than using standardized test scores and feedback (which is also subjective)

## level of uncertainty: 
### i am willing to accept a medium amount of risk because the first couple versions of the model may be less accurate due to the quality of data collected. but if we continue to revise it, the risks can be reduced.
